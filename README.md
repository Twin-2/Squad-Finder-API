## Routes

### **Authentication Routes**  

<br >

*USER MODEL: {*  

  *username: STRING*  

  *password: STRING*  

  *role: ENUM LIST*  

  *token: VIRTUAL*  

  *capabilities: VIRTUAL*  

*}*

- **POST** `/signup` - Create a user profile with a username and password as strings.

  - Your password will not be saved to the DB. It is encrypted before being saved for your protection.

  - CODE REF: `authRouter.post('/signup', signup)`

- **POST** `/signin` - Pass in a username and a password for an account that has already been created. Uses basic auth practices to verify your identiy and log you in.

  - CODE REF: `authRouter.post('/signin', basicAuth, signin)`

### **Profile Routes**


<br >

*PROFILE MODEL: {*  

  *username: STRING*  

  *bio: STRING*  

  *games: ENUM LIST*    

*}*

- All routes use bearer authentication middleware that requires you to be signed in.

- **POST** `/profile` - Takes in a body object of a bio(*string*) and a game(s) which are from a set list (Madden, Fortnite, Minecraft, League of Legends for now) and creates a new record in the database for the logged in user with that info.

  - This list will eventually be displayed on a UI as a dropdown menu to be selected from.

  - CODE REF: `profileRouter.post('/profile', bearerAuth, acl('create'), handleCreate)`

- **GET** `/profile` - Returns the profile data from the signed in user.

  - CODE REF: `profileRouter.get('/profile', bearerAuth, acl('read'), handleGetOne)`

- **PUT** `/profile` - Takes in a body object that can have bio or game names (from the above list) and will update the signed in user's profile on the database.

  - CODE REF: `profileRouter.put('/profile' bearerAuth, acl('update'), handleUpdateOne)`

- **DELETE** `/profile` - Allows for the removal of the logged in user's profile from the database.

  - CODE REF: `profileRouter.delete('/profile', bearerAuth, acl('delete'), handleDeleteOne)`

### **Achievement Routes**

<br >

*ACHIEVEMENTS MODEL: {*  

  *game: STRING*  

  *rank: STRING*  

  *progress: ENUM LIST*  

  *lastplayed: DATE*  

*}*

- All routes use bearer authentication middleware that requires you to be signed in.

- **POST** `/achievements` - Takes in an object with game(*string*), rank(*string*), progress(*string*), lastplayed(*date*). Then creates a record in the database with that info.

  - Each game must be unique and should align with the games on the user's profile.

  - CODE REF: `achievementsRouter.post('/achievements', bearerAuth, acl('create'), handleCreate)`

- **GET** `/achievements` - Returns the database record of achievements for the signed in user.

  - CODE REF: `achievementsRouter.get('/achievements', bearerAuth, acl('read'), handleGetAll)`  

- **GET** `/achievements/:id` - Returns the database record of the specific achievement record based on the id from the route parameter.
  - CODE REF: `achievementsRouter.get('/achievements/:id', bearerAuth, acl('read'), handleGetOne)`

- **PUT** `/achievements/:id` - Returns the updated record of the signed in user's achievements. Takes an object matching the above mentioned schema for input.
  - CODE REF: `achievementsRouter.put('/achievements/:id', bearerAuth, acl('update'), handleUpdate)`

- **DELETE** `/achievements/:id` - Allows for deletion of a specific achievement from the database as long as the signed in user is the owner of the achievement.
  - CODE REF: `achievementsRouter.delete('/achievements/:id', bearerAuth, acl('delete'), handleDelete)`

  - CODE REF: `friendsRouter.get('/users', getAllUsers)`

- **GET** `/friendRequests` - Returns all current friend request for the signed in user.
  - CODE REF: `friendsRouter.get('/friendRequests', bearerAuth, showAllRequests)`

- **DELETE** `/friendRequests/:id` - Removes the selected friend request from the database. Selection is based on the route parameter id. This id is the id of the user that made the request.
  - CODE REF: `friendsRouter.delete('/friendRequests/:id', bearerAuth, rejectRequest)`

- **POST** `/friends/:id` - Adds a friend to the database between the logged in user and user of the id from the route parameter.
